Name
    xss-nginx-module - Native cross-site scripting support in nginx

Synopsis

   # accessing /foo?callback=process gives the response
   # body "process(...);" (without quotes) where "..."
   # is the original response body of the /foo location.
   server {
        location /foo {
            # your content handler goes here...

            xss_get on;
            xss_callback_arg 'callback';
            xss_input_types 'application/json'; # default
            xss_output_type 'application/x-javascript'; # default
        }
        ...
    }

Description
    This module adds cross-site AJAX support to nginx. Currently only
    cross-site GET is supported. But cross-site POST will be added
    in the future.

    The cross-site GET is currently implemented as JSONP
    (or "JSON with padding"). See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP >
    for more details.

Directives
    * xss_get on | off
        Syntax: xss_get on | off
        Default: xss_get off
        Context: main, http, location, if location

        Enable JSONP support for GET requests.

    * xss_callback_arg
        Syntax: xss_callback_arg <name>
        Default: none
        Context: main, http, location, if location

        Specify the JavaScript callback function name
        used in the responses.

        For example,

            location /foo {
                xss_get on;
                xss_callback_arg c;
                ...
            }

        then

            GET /foo?c=blah

        returns

            blah(...);

    * xss_override_status
        Syntax: xss_override_status on | off
        Default: xss_check_status on
        Context: main, http, location, if location

        Whether to override 30x, 40x and 50x status to 200
        when the response is actually being processed.

    * xss_check_status
        Syntax: xss_check_status on | off
        Default: xss_check_status on
        Context: main, http, location, if location

        By default, ngx_xss only process responses with the status code
        200 or 201.

    * xss_input_types
        Syntax: xss_input_types [mime-type]...
        Default: xss_input_types application/json
        Context: main, http, location, if location

        Only processes the responses of the specified MIME types.

        Example:
            xss_input_types application/json text/plain;

Trouble Shooting
    Use the "info" error log level (or lower) to get more
    diagnostics when things go wrong.

Installation
    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.54 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.54.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.54.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.54/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/xss-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    xss-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/xss-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   1.0.x (last tested: 1.0.2)

    *   0.9.x (last tested: 0.9.4)

    *   0.8.x (last tested: 0.8.54)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.30 (last tested: 0.7.67)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.30 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

TODO
    *   add cross-site POST support.
